# Chapter 4 - Lists

Lists are at the core of functional programming. A large number of applications can be modelled and implemented using lists.

This chapter introduces the List concept including: list values, patterns and basic operations, and we study a collection of recursion schemas over lists.

At the end of the chapter  model-based approach to functional programming is introduced
