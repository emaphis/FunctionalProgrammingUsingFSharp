# Chapter 1 - Getting started

This chapter will cover the main concepts of functional programming: value, expression, declaration,
recursive function and types.

Furthermore, to explain the meaning of programs we will introduce the notions: binding, environment and evaluation of expression

These concepts are introduced early to make it possible to cover interesting programs.

Sections covering largely interactive examples will be added to `*.fsx` files.
