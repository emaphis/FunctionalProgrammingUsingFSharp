## Notes

The `src\Chapter00` and `tests\Chapter00Tests` projects are scratch projects for examples and experiments.

I'm using `XUnit` and `Swensen.Unquote` for unit testing. `Unqute` makes nice F# expression assertions and it's assertions can be run in `FSI` and *.fsx scripts.

See `Chapter00Tests\UnquoteExamples.fsx` and `Chapter00Tests\UnquoteTests.fs` for examples
